# Malignant Comment Classification
## A Classification model designed to detect the type of toxic comments to detect and prevent online bullying

### The Major Libraries which have to be installed for running this project are :
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- numpy
- tweepy
- pickle
- random
- pandas
- re
- csv
- scikit-multilearn
- keras
- tensorflow
- stop_words
- matplotlib
- nltk
- json
- string
- wordcloud

### The dataset for training/testing can be obtained from kaggle at :
[https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge]
We have used the file train.csv available in the zip folder to train our model as the dataset is available for training.

## We have also extracted data from twitter using twitterStream and stored it in a csv file called hate_final.csv.

## After the model is trained we are using the Model.predict functionality to analyze the type of toxic comments which are appearing online.
